# Blockchain_as_a_Platform_for_Cloud_Computing_Services

## Introduction

In this study, two mechanisms that operate on cloud@blockchain are developed to improve upon existing cloud computing services.
A. Anonymous file sharing: The cloud storage service collects a large amount of user data. The anonymous file sharing mechanism on cloud@blockchain allows users to share files with their privacy protected.
B. Inspection for illegally uploaded files: A unique fingerprint is generated and uploaded to the blockchain for storage. Whenever a file is uploaded, whether the file uploader is the owner can be easily determined. 

Developed a blockchain-based system for secure cloud computing services.
Implemented a transparent and secure system for recording digital asset transactions.


## Technologies Used

- Programming Language - Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL
- Blockchain Platforms
- Smart Contract Languages
- Web3 Libraries
- Cloud Computing Frameworks

## Services Used

- Decentralized Storage Services:
Decentralized storage solutions like IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) or Swarm are integrated to enable distributed and secure storage of data. This ensures data availability even in the presence of network disruptions or failures.

- Blockchain Network Deployment Services:
Services like Infura (for Ethereum) or IBM Blockchain Platform are utilized for deploying and managing the blockchain network. These services simplify the process of setting up and maintaining blockchain nodes.

- Identity Management Services:
Blockchain-based identity management platforms, such as uPort or Sovrin, play a crucial role in managing user identities and access controls. These platforms provide secure and decentralized identity verification.

- Cloud Service APIs:
Public cloud service APIs, like Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure, may be integrated to enhance the project's cloud service offerings. These APIs provide additional functionalities and access to a vast array of cloud-based services.
