## Introduction

In this study, two mechanisms that operate on cloud@blockchain are developed to improve upon existing cloud computing services.
A. Anonymous file sharing: The cloud storage service collects a large amount of user data. The anonymous file sharing mechanism on cloud@blockchain allows users to share files with their privacy protected.
B. Inspection for illegally uploaded files: A unique fingerprint is generated and uploaded to the blockchain for storage. Whenever a file is uploaded, whether the file uploader is the owner can be easily determined.
